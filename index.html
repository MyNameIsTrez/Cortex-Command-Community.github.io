<p>Welcome to the home of Data Realms' first independently developed game, Cortex Command! It features real-time tactical battles, and also a strategic, turn-based metagame on top, with support for up to four players in split-screen. It won two awards in the Independent Games Festival 2009.

Dynamic 2D pixel graphics coupled with an extremely detailed physics engine makes for replayable and emergent gameplay. Scroll down for more information about the concept, story, and features of this labor of love!</p>


<p>the cortex command community project is a fan-driven, community written updated, and actively worked on version of the base game, with tons of improvement<p>
